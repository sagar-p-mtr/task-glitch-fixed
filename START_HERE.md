## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues

**"Git push rejected"**
```bash
# Check your remote URL
git remote -v
# Should show your GitHub repo URL
# If wrong, remove and add correct one:
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/task-glitch-fixed.git
```

**"Vercel build fails"**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Usually it's a missing dependency
- Try locally: `npm install && npm run build`

**"App shows blank page"**
- Open console (F12) and check for errors
- Verify `tasks.json` exists in `public/` folder
- Clear cache and hard reload (Ctrl + Shift + R)
